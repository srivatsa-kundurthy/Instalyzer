# Instalyzer
A very old project that allows users to pull information from Instagram profiles, and can automatically send the same 
DM individually to multiple users specified in a text file.  
Required modules:
selenium, pyautogui, instaloader  
Required webdriver: chromedriver (installation guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz59GsdvUF8)  
'main.py' is structured to simplify usage. There is also a simplified GUI version of this project, which executes by running 
'Instalyzer_GUI.py'.
